## Letter 1

_To Mrs. Saville, England._

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17â€”.

You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
forebodings.  I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
of my undertaking.
